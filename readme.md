# Presentation
This project named "BagPackers" was built in 36 hours during [Oxford Hackathon 2016](http://www.oxfordhack.com) and won the [Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.com) API Prize.

# Inspiration
Meeting each other and making friends lead to the discussion of something almost every university student has on their bucket lists: backpacking. Wandering off on your own without any plan seems like fun, but we realised that as adventurous as we may be, some things such as finding cheap places to stay at along the route are quite necessary. Alas, Bag'Packers was born.

# What it does
This web app takes in the details of your trip, and proposes a route you could take during your journey. It also proposes an itinerary for you, taking into account how much hiking you would have done in a day, and shows you various options for cheap hostels and places to stay at where you'd be stopping your day's hike.

It also has a feature from long-distances driving, proposing the cheapest hotels to stay during a long trip.

# How we built it
Using Skyscanner and google's API. Written in Python and integrated in Django. HTML, CSS and JavasScript for front end.

## Installation
- Install python and django framework (with pip)
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/othmanus/oxfordhack-2016`
- Go to the root of the project and run the app `python manage.py runserver`
- Go to the browser, the app should be running at the address `http://localhost:8000/backpackers`

# What's next for BagPackers
To keep improving on what we have built to make it better and simpler with more features. Also create a mobile app.
